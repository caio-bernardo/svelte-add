```

### 🏞 Supported environments

This adder supports SvelteKit and Vite-powered Svelte apps (all the environments `svelte-add` currently supports).

## 🛠 Using PicoCSS

After the adder runs,

- You can use Pico CSS classes like `container` or `grid` in the markup (components, routes, `app.html`).

- You can [customize your Pico CSS theme with variables](https://picocss.com/docs/customization.html) like `$primary` in `src/variables.scss`.
